Feature: Intra-account transfers

  As a customer
  I want to transfer money between my accounts
  So that I can manage my funds more effectively

  Background:
    Given I am logged into my online banking
    And I have two accounts: "Everyday" and "Savings"

  Scenario: Successful transfer from Everyday to Savings
    Given my Everyday account has a balance of $1000
    And my Savings account has a balance of $500
    When I transfer $200 from Everyday to Savings
    Then the Everyday account balance should be $800
    And the Savings account balance should be $700

  Scenario: Failed transfer due to insufficient balance
    Given my Everyday account has a balance of $100
    When I try to transfer $200 from Everyday to Savings
    Then the transfer should be declined
    And my Everyday account balance should remain $100
    And my Savings account balance should remain unchanged

  Scenario Outline: Transfer with fee adjustment for staff
    Given <user> is a <role>
    And their account "Everyday" has $1000
    And their account "Savings" has $500
    When they transfer $200 from "Everyday" to "Savings"
    Then the "Everyday" account should be debited by <expected_debit>
    And the "Savings" account should increase by $200

    Examples:
      | user        | role      | expected_debit |
      | John Smith  | customer  | 202.00         |
      | Jane Admin  | staff     | 200.00         |
